# pokeapiCrawlerAndParseUploader
crawl json data from pokeapi.co and upload part of the data to parse server

you need to create a file called parseConfig.json before run the app.js
Also, I put a localParseServer script so you can host a local Parse server for testing.

I have crawled data from v1 api and you can change the setting in config.js
